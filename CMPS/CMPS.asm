; 1. The INCLUDELIB and ExitProcess PROTO lines are removed since they are specific to Microsoft's MASM syntax.
; 2. The .DATA section is renamed to section .data.
; 3. The BYTE data type is replaced with db (define byte) since NASM uses a different syntax for defining data.
; 4. The main PROC and main ENDP lines are removed since NASM does not use this syntax for defining procedures.
; 5. The END statement is removed since it is not required in NASM.
; 6. The _start label is added, which is the entry point for Linux executables.
; 7. The ExitProcess call is replaced with a Linux system call (syscall) to exit the program. The system call number for exit is 60, and the exit status is set to 0 
; 8. The memory addressing syntax has been adjusted to conform to NASM's syntax. For example, [rel src] is used to access the memory address of the src label.
; 9. The SIZEOF operator is replaced with the explicit length of the string (3 in this case) since NASM doesn't have a built-in SIZEOF operator.
; 10. The JNZ and JMP instructions are used for branching, as in the original MASM code.
; 11. The assignment to the match variable is done using the memory addressing syntax [rel match].
